1. analysis and processing of attention and emb in gpt2-attention.ipynb; will output and save gpt2_attention.txt as well as gpt2_emb.txt, which will be used to compare with neural data

2. neural data and Model comparason in compare_neural_model.ipynb, with some neural data exploration
    neural data part needs preprocessed RDM
3. messy and original code in try.ipynb about attention（bert included）
4. plot_patagraph_cosinesim.ipynb use emb automatically create semantic nodes instead of manually defining
